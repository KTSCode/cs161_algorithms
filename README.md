# Algorithms
## Description
  In this project, I will be writing the algorithms being taught in my CS161 Algorithms course at UCI.
  For each algorithm I will:
  * Describe its function
  * Give its complexity
  * Define lower and upper bounds for it
  * Give any other pertinent information

## Modules
  * Algorithms: This is my base module, its module doc will give a good overview of how algorithms will be categorized
    * Functions: non so far I may put efficiency tests in here I'm not sure yet
  * Algorithms.Max: This module is solely for the Max Value function
    * Functions:
      * max_value (see doc for more details)

### TODO:
  * [x] Add Description
  * [ ] Program Karatsuba Algorithm for Integer Multiplication
  * [ ] Finish Introduction in Algorithms Moduledoc
  * [ ] Create Searching Module
  * [ ] Create Sorting Module
